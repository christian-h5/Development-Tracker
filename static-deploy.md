# Static Deployment Guide for DevTracker Pro

## Overview
DevTracker Pro is already configured as a client-side application using localStorage for data persistence, making it perfect for static deployment.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Vite build system
- **Data Storage**: Browser localStorage (no server dependency)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query with client-side API layer
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with component library

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Replit Static Deployment
1. Use the existing Vite build configuration
2. The app is already configured for static deployment in the current setup
3. Deploy using Replit's built-in static hosting

### Option 2: Manual Static Build
1. Run `npm run build` to create the production build
2. Upload the `dist/public` directory to any static hosting provider:
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - GitHub Pages
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront
   - Firebase Hosting

### Option 3: Alternative Static Hosts
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the build folder
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repository and deploy
- **Firebase**: Use Firebase CLI to deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: Push to gh-pages branch

## Current Configuration
The app is already set up for static deployment:

- ✅ Client-side only architecture
- ✅ LocalStorage for data persistence
- ✅ No server dependencies for core functionality
- ✅ Vite build configuration optimized for static hosting
- ✅ All API calls handled client-side
- ✅ Export/import functionality for data backup

## Key Features That Work Statically
- Project tracking and management
- Phase and unit calculations
- Financial analysis and reporting
- PDF export functionality
- Data export/import for backup
- Unit calculator with sensitivity analysis
- All CRUD operations through localStorage

## Files Structure After Build
```
dist/public/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── [hashed-js-files].js
│   ├── [hashed-css-files].css
│   └── [other-assets]
└── [other-static-files]
```

## Performance Optimizations
